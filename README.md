# Project Hub
A comprehensive platform designed to serve as a centralized resource for university students to explore and share graduation project ideas across various departments and institutions.

# Project Overview
Project Hub was inspired by the challenges students face when searching for existing or innovative ideas for their graduation projects. This platform allows students to both browse a collection of project ideas from diverse academic disciplines and submit their own projects to be featured. The goal is to create a knowledge-sharing ecosystem that helps students collaborate, find inspiration, and develop impactful projects.
